# COVID-19 Data Exploration

This Jupyter notebook looks at using an API from the [UK Government](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide).

The purpose of this exercise is for myself to improve my data analysis and programming skills in Python.

Feel free to clone this repo if you want to take a look around! The requirements for running this notebook have been exported to the requirements.txt file.
